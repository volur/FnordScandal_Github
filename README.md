The Fnord Scandal

Welcome to UCAS Toronto, the 3rd largest and cleanest city in the UCAS. The year is 2055 and the antics of populist mayor Rob Fnord are the highlights of the local news outlets.
You are a no-level nub, living in a squat and working a dead-end part-time job at Stuffer Shack. You dream of bigger things - running in the shadows, hitting a mega pay day and living the high life somewhere exotic.

This is a UGC created in Shadowrun Returns: Hong Kong
